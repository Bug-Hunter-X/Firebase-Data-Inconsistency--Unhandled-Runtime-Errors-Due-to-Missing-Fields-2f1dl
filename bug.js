The following code snippet demonstrates an uncommon Firebase error related to security rules and data structure.  The error arises when attempting to retrieve data from a collection where the document structure is inconsistent, specifically when some documents lack a required field expected by your client-side code.

```javascript
// Client-side code (e.g., React, Angular, etc.)
db.collection('users').get().then((querySnapshot) => {
  querySnapshot.forEach((doc) => {
    // This will throw an error if 'displayName' is missing in some documents
    const displayName = doc.data().displayName; 
    console.log(displayName);
  });
});
```

This might not immediately cause a crash, but it will lead to an unhandled promise rejection or silently fail on some documents.  The Firebase console may not directly show an error in the rules, as it is a runtime issue related to data consistency.
